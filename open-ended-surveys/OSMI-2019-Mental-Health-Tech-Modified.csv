Since there was no option in the survey to be on benefit support I chose to write about my last employment.","At times there was understanding, at others it took me to the brink and I had to bail out of the job since it started to appear to me that people took either advantage of me via gaslighting or began to poke and see how I felt and how I would react to various tests. The stress at times became unbearable. Though through the years it has become easier and more acceptable at least somewhat.","They spoke of their own depression and it seemed to me that it was to elicit my own story so that I would open up.

FALSE,More than 1000,Somewhat difficult,"My current manager will be retiring in the next few months. We've talked about my mental illness and related mental health issues, but I'd be a lot less comfortable talking about it with my new/next manager. During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies. 

I'm seriously considering negotiating down to part time work because I don't want to spend my energy navigating the medical/legal parts of the healthcare/leave system. I'd rather get paid for the work I can do well then fight for accommodation.","I've discussed mental illness with coworkers not in my business unit whom I have a primarily social relationship with.

They've been supportive, but also had the deer-in-headlights ""I have no clue what to say here"" look that makes me hesitant to share in the future.
